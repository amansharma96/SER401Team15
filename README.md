## Project Description

### The Problem
In the event of a natural disaster, volunteer responders are needed to provide accurate and timely information to the command center who organizes the relief effort. Historically the documents used for gathering data were paper forms, or an inconvenient group of software applications.

### Our Solution
To make the process more efficient, easier to understand and deploy, and easier to manage the data once collected, our team has elected to develop a mobile application. This application will gather the required information in a simplistic way, and handle the storage and delivery of the data. This application will be Android and iOS compatible. The output data will be in JSON message format, easily manage by many big data software solutions.

### Project Roles
- Scrum Master: Guides the team in performing effective Scrum meetings and sprints.
    - 
- Product Owner: Ensures the Teamâ€™s focus is in line with the needs of the customer, and the product backlog reflects the requirements set forth by the team and customer.
    - 
- Github Owner: Responsible for organization of the Github Repository and responsible for the merges from the development branch to the main branch. All development will be performed from branches off of the development branch.
    - 
- Sponsor Liaison: Ensures the sponsor is an active member of the development and is the main point of contact for asking questions and relaying this information to the team.
